Firstly, the app needs to determine its id
Once it knows its id, it looks up in the assignments file what to run
Then it runs it
Then it exits

Detemining id

2. If lock file is there, sleep a little and check again
3. Try to create control file with my name as content. if this fails, sleep a little and goto step 2
4. Check contents of control file. If is not mine, sleep a little and goto step 2
5. Now we look at the nextid file. if it is not there, myid=1
6. overwrite or create nextid file, and put in it myid+1
7. remove the lock file

control/lock
control/nextid
control/assignments.xml
